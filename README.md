I am Jeffrey Rujen from India and I am a college student who is doing B.Tech in Information Technology from Amity University, Noida. I enjoy learning new concepts, frameworks and
languages like Progressive Web Apps, Cross Platform Development, React and React Native. Currently I am working on frontend skills, aspiring to become a full stack developer. JavaScript and Python are the languages I work with the most. You can reach me at twitter.com/jeffreyrujen or linked.in.com/in/jeffreyrujen or
